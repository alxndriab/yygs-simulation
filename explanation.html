            <h3>Example of analyzing data of Covid-19 death rates in the United States</h3>
            <br>
            <p>For an idea of how data can be so helpful for so many here’s an example in the COVID-19 pandemic, “...multiple new experiments in data gathering and analysis have sprung up during the pandemic, experiments that might save thousands of lives before the crisis is over. And they may well prevent future pandemics from developing in the first place”.
            And they soon found that the more data the better.
            “By early February, the Open Covid-19 Data Working Group had assembled detailed records for 10,000 cases. Today an informal network of hundreds of volunteers has assembled records for more than a million cases in 142 countries around the world. It may well be the single most accurate portrait of the virus’s spread through the human population in existence”. This is huge. The better the accuracy, the more likely they can find a solution that can make an impact. And with all the samples, they cast such a wide net that they can see how people were affected from all over. This is basically a scientist's dream to have this much data. 
            “Of course, the greatest value in that kind of data set lies in the clues it can give us about the future path of the disease and how that path can potentially be interrupted”.
            <br><br>
            <b></b>Conclusions:
            With this data, scientists were able to draw conclusions such as,
            “Life tables are what allowed us to see that Covid-19’s lethality has been disproportionately concentrated among the elderly, unlike the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an unusual number of young adults”.

            <div class="container col-sm-8 blue-box" id="yellow-box">
                <h4>Geographical Location</h4>
                <p>There are often systemic imbalances in the level of infrastructure and government institutions within certain areas or local communities that are partially dependent upon the living standards and wealth of the demographics who reside in it. 
                <br><br>
                Logically, the demand, and subsequently price of housing in the market is increased the more accessible it is to public infrastructure as it is both a convenience and need that individuals want to access. Thus, areas that have the best healthcare systems are likely the most locked out for ethnic minorities/racial groups.

                <h4>Initial health disparities between caucasian and ethnic minorities</h4>
                <p>Minorities are less likely to be screened for illnesses, treatment is expensive, food insecurity and importance on health. Level of stress can also cause damage. 6% of non-hispanic white people were uninsured, while 19% of Hispanics were uninsured, and 10% of non-Hispanic Black people were uninsured.</p>

                <h4>Financial Status (costs on household due to covid-19) (location adjusted)</h4>
                <p>The objective utility or inutility of catching covid or being hospitalized from covid is different across different individuals. Couple of examples:</p>
                <p>- e.g. Opportunity Cost during 2-week recovery: ethnic minorities in less wealthy, redlined neighborhoods are disproportionately more likely to be in essential occupations “public workers, service industry”</p>
                <p>- e.g. Costs of Hospitalization per capita: ​​The overall cost among 654673 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was $16.2 billion. Estimated per-patient hospitalization cost was $24 826.</p>
                <p>Among surviving patients, estimated per-patient cost was $13 090 without intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), $21 222 with ICU admission alone, and $59,742 with IMV. Estimated per-patient cost among patients who died was $27 017
                    e.g. Federal Taxation Revenue for Public/Private Healthcare Rebates = affects the post-tax income of marginalized communities. 2.9% Medicare/Medicaid levy = up to high amounts (not free)</p>

                <h4>Occupation/Jobs/Interaction</h4>
                <p>The rate of exposure for African Americans to covid is much greater within their jobs than for caucasian individuals, simply due to the nature of the employment which less privileged individuals receive. For example a restaurant manager which deals with how many people a day. 25% of public transit users are made up of African Americans. People of color are 50% more likely to be working a service job. People of color make up 30% of nurses.</p>

                <h4>Access to vaccines & tests</h4>
                <p>Notoriously slower rollouts within several communities: multiple reasons involved including vaccine hesitancy, lack of federal funding to administer medical professionals that give out vaccines, long wait lists, confusion and lack of knowledge on the vaccination process, supply side.</p>
