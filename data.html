        <p id="lead-para">Back in the day, in our grandparents' generation, information spread less efficiently than today. There were things like television, but it wasn’t as expansive. We extended knowledge through our voices, then and now. Today, we have experienced the widening of social media - a new way to communicate through the internet. And this has made strides in the way we share our voice. It has amplified advocacy; inciting protests and people's gatherings. It has also magnified trailblazers and all the numerous things going on with the government. But, social media cannot take all the credit. In the 1900s a lot of forms were invented and used for the very same reason.</p>

                    <p>New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez streamed on the Twitch platform raising election awareness for half a million young voters. She was able to engage young adults, who are often non-political, by adapting to the new technology of Twitch, and help them develop a voting plan through IWillVote.com. She helped to empower young voters that are issue focused and was the highest driver for the IWillVote website.</p>

                    <p>From 1954 to 1968, named the movement for African Americans began the fight for equal and protected rights and social justice, including a critical leader: Martin Luther King Junior. He was able to spread his message by physically traveling to other states with his coalition. He faced nativism even in the neighboring state of Alabama, and each state was a new challenge. But through the racist media coverage and heavy disapproval from state and government officials, his message rang true. </p>

                    <h4>Our Age</h4>
                    <p>The 2016 election marked a turning point not only in social media, but also the freedom of speech. Conspiracies flared on the news as soon as on Twitter, automated pro-Trump accounts sent seven times more messages than pro-Clinton accounts, and WIRED goes on to say “most of [the] accounts, it turned out, were powered by chatbots: the newest tool in computational propaganda”. Now, development of masses of hive-mind social media accounts and news reports created a “big propellant” and influence on electing the United States President.</p>

                    <p>The invention of black and white television also revolutionized political campaigns. Commercials, opposed to the classic live advertisements allowed for no mistakes, concise messaging, and perfect wording and visualisations. And in the 1952 election, President Eisenhower brought on a specialist to create his leading Anacin commercial. Public media became the mode of promotion and marketing, creating the new group: the public eye.</p>
