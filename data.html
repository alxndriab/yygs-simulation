Education-focused unions and organizations have been developing since the Antebellum Era. And each year, the new devices, techniques, digitalization, and forms of communication and work progress into more efficient and creative-stimulating works to engage the future creators.

            <h3>Example of analyzing data of Covid-19 death rates in the United States</h3>
            <br>
            <p>For an idea of how data can be so helpful for so many here’s an example in the COVID-19 pandemic, “...multiple new experiments in data gathering and analysis have sprung up during the pandemic, experiments that might save thousands of lives before the crisis is over. And they may well prevent future pandemics from developing in the first place”.
            And they soon found that the more data the better.
            “By early February, the Open Covid-19 Data Working Group had assembled detailed records for 10,000 cases. Today an informal network of hundreds of volunteers has assembled records for more than a million cases in 142 countries around the world. It may well be the single most accurate portrait of the virus’s spread through the human population in existence”. This is huge. The better the accuracy, the more likely they can find a solution that can make an impact. And with all the samples, they cast such a wide net that they can see how people were affected from all over. This is basically a scientist's dream to have this much data. 
            “Of course, the greatest value in that kind of data set lies in the clues it can give us about the future path of the disease and how that path can potentially be interrupted”.
            <br><br>
            <b></b>Conclusions:
            With this data, scientists were able to draw conclusions such as,
            “Life tables are what allowed us to see that Covid-19’s lethality has been disproportionately concentrated among the elderly, unlike the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an unusual number of young adults”.

                    <p>Parents often say that TV isn’t educational and will melt your brain, figuratively of course. But that isn’t true. Today we have many educational channels like PBS and National Geographic. But it was much earlier that this began. 
                        The Ford Foundation was important in the creation of educational TV. In the 1950s, television started to be considered for a teaching device, even setting aside 242 educational channels”. Although later in the 1980s it lost traction and funding thanks to the highly favored computers.
                        “U.S. Commissioner of Education Earl James McGrath, declared, ‘Through the use of television, educational institutions will be able to bring the greatest teachers, the finest artists, scientists, and philosophers into schools and homes.’”

                    <p>AR has made great strides in recent years, and therefore its abilities in education have too. “Autodesk has recently been 3D scanning the historic Apollo 11 lunar module, which has slowly been degrading over time. Capturing that data allows us to preserve a digital copy of the Apollo 11 — but more importantly it allows us to share it with others for educational purposes. When combined with AR and VR capabilities, this means students in classrooms around the country — and around the world — can virtually step into the Apollo 11 and experience it for themselves".</p>

                    <p>VR has the capability to technically transport you into a new world which helps engagement in a lesson thanks to the virtual hands-on interaction. It helps students by providing an immersive, interactive experience. For one, it has helped students with autism and other learning difficulties, “A 2007 study showed that children with autism could effectively apply skills they had learned in a virtual environment — like fire and street/road safety — to the real world”. And VR can also help with social and communication skills. A start-up called Floreo uses VR technology to help students with autism practice interacting with others and more.</p>

                    <p>Games are at least one of kids’ favorite things, and gamification has brought gaming into education. An app called Duolingo utilizes gaming to teach languages. A feature of duolingo is its “timed task-based game” with rewards and varying levels. However, there is some debate about how gamification really impacts students, “While educators are likely to focus on how gamification keeps students engaged and self-motivated, critics point out that embedding entertainment into learning can make students more easily distracted”. Still though, it has definitely impacted the way we learn. And although we don’t know its long-term effects, - if used right it - it provides a nice break from regular school work.</p>

This is shown when Zoom went from 10 million daily users in December of 2020 to over 300 million daily users around April of 2020. And it is still being used daily in 2021. Needless to say, online communication like Zoom plays a heavy role in keeping the school community connected.</p>
