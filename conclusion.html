                    <h3>What can you do to make sure the government responds better?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>VOTE! While it might seem obvious, your ability to vote for representatives that care about healthcare precautions and racial equity is vital. And spread the word. Inform others of the reprecussions of this pandemic in order to ensure that minorities aren't disproportionately affected by major pandemics in the future or even epidemics.</p>
                    <p>Tell your representative that it matters. Be sure to name specific details in emails or complaints. Tell them that there needs to be a rapid-response plan to an outbreak. Tell them that ethics boards need to be consulted when creating that plan. Tell them that ensuring equity among all communities must be supervised.</p>
                    <p>Attend or organize local ralleys in order to support legislation that would safeguard against disparities in healthcare treatments for minority communities. You are not alone in this fight, so never advocate alone. Reach out to organizations that also support these safeguards.</p>

                    <h3>How can this be applied to other countries?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Similar methods can be used globally. The most significant one, though, would be improving the technological infrastructure, especially in developing countries. By ensuring doctors have a universal database to identify what areas need assistance and what areas have been vaccinated are vital. It also helps sending medical resources to areas more efficient and impactful if they know where to go. So investing in these technologies is crucial to future precautions.</p>
                    <p>Also, education campaigns are vital. Ensuring that everyone knows when to social distance, why to social distance, and how to social distance is super important. Getting information out, and fast to people is how we can stop the spread quickly and efficiently.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, we have to make sure we recognize and support the populations that are disproportionately affected and help them. Distributing PPE to doctors on the ground, donating technology to kids so they can continue schooling, and funding low-income areas to help them through tough times.</p>

            By working together, being smart, and being prepared, billions of people will not have to suffer through a half-decade long pandemic. While we might not be able to completely stop epidemics and pandemics from occuring, we can make sure that we act quick and ensure it doesn't spread. It is Post Pandemic Administration Policy. We learn from the pandemic and we implement policies to prepare ourselves.
